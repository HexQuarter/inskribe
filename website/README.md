# Inskribe

Inskribe is a Bitcoin-native authorship and provenance platform.
It allows creators, publishers, and organizations to register their works on-chain, verify originality, and preserve authorship forever through Bitcoin inscriptions.

## Motivation

Inskribe makes authorship verifiable and permanent.
By anchoring creative works directly to Bitcoin, it establishes a transparent record of origin, edition, and evolution — creating an immutable lineage of ideas and contributions.
 
It is meant for:
	•	Authorship Registration: Anchor a book, manuscript, or creative work on Bitcoin with a verifiable timestamp.
	•	Provenance Tracking: Trace editions, updates, and derivative works through on-chain lineage.
	•	Verification Portal: Publicly confirm a work’s authenticity by comparing its proof to the Bitcoin record.
	•	White-Label Access: Publishers and creative networks can operate their own branded Inskribe instance.

Inskribe relies on those principles:
•	Bitcoin-native: every proof is anchored on the most secure blockchain.
•	Transparent: authorship and edition lineage are publicly verifiable.
•	Permissionless: anyone can inscribe, verify, or build upon previous works.
•	Creator-first: authorship and originality are protected and preserved.

## Status

Inskribe is currently in development with an initial focus on:
	•	Authorship proof anchoring via Bitcoin inscriptions
	•	Edition lineage through Merkle and provenance links
	•	Certificate-based verification system
